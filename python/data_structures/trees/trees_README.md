# ‚ú® Summary
- A **tree** is a node-based data structure where each node can have links to multiple other nodes. 
- A **binary tree** is a tree in which each node has zero, one or two children. 
- A **binary search tree** is a binary tree that also abides by the following rules:  
  - Each node can have at most one "left" child and one "right" child. 
  - A node's "left" decendants can only contain values that are less than the node itself. Likewise, a node's "right" decendants can only contain values that are greater than the node itself. 

# ‚ú® Description

  - pre-order
