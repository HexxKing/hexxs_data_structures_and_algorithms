# ✨ Summary
## Reverse an array.

# ✨ Description
### Write a function called `reverse_array` which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

### Once you’ve achieved a working solution, implement the same feature with a different methodology. What different techniques do you have when working with arrays? Recursion, loops, indexes, modifying the array input directly…?

# ✨ Big-O
  - ## ⏱️ Time : O(n)
    Computation time will only take as long as the list is long.
  - ## 💾 Space : O(1)
    - No new data is created, the array/list is simply reversed in place.
