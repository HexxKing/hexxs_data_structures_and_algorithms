# Code Challenges

Code challenges are problems or puzzles that require a solution through programming. They are often used as a means to practice and improve coding skills, problem-solving abilities, and algorithmic thinking.

Code challenges serve as a practical application of data structures and algorithms. They help programmers enhance their problem-solving skills, understand how to choose appropriate data structures, and optimize algorithms for efficient solutions.

## 📚  Implementation Roadmap

  - **FizzBuzz**: Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to n. For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of 5, print "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".
  - **Palindrome Check**: Create a function that determines if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward), ignoring non-alphanumeric characters and considering case.
  - **Reverse a String**: Write a function to reverse a given string without using built-in reverse functions.
  - **Anagram Detection**: Create a function that checks if two given strings are anagrams of each other (contain the same characters but may be in a different order).

  **Where to find more Code Challenges:**
  - Solving problems on coding platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or CodeSignal.
  - Participating in coding competitions like ACM ICPC, Google Code Jam, or Codeforces.
  - Completing programming exercises in textbooks or online courses.
