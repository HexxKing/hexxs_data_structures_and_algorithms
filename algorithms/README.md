- **Sorting Algorithms**
  - Sorting algorithms are a set of techniques used to arrange elements in a specific order, typically in ascending or descending order based on some criteria. Sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science and plays a crucial role in various applications, including searching, data analysis, and database operations. 
  - Each sorting algorithm has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of which to use depends on factors such as the size of the dataset, the distribution of data, and the available resources.
  - **Selection Sort** is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It divides the input array into a sorted and an unsorted region. In each iteration, the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted region is selected and swapped with the first element of the unsorted region.
  - **Insertion Sort** is another elementary sorting algorithm. It builds the sorted array one element at a time. It takes each element from the unsorted part of the array and inserts it into its correct position in the sorted region, shifting the other elements accordingly.
  <!-- - **Heap Sort** is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure. It first builds a max-heap (for ascending order) or a min-heap (for descending order). The root element (maximum or minimum) is then swapped with the last element in the array, and the heap property is restored. This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted. -->
  - **Bucket Sort** is a distribution sort algorithm that distributes elements into a finite number of buckets. Each bucket is then sorted individually, either using a different sorting algorithm or recursively applying the bucket sort. Finally, the sorted elements from all the buckets are concatenated to produce the sorted array.
  - **Radix Sort** is a non-comparative integer sorting algorithm that sorts numbers by processing individual digits. It can be applied to integers or strings of digits. The algorithm processes the digits from the least significant to the most significant (or vice versa), using a stable sort for each pass.
  - **Counting Sort** is a non-comparative integer sorting algorithm that works by counting the number of occurrences of each element and using those counts to reconstruct the sorted array. It assumes that the input elements are integers within a specific range.
  - **Shell Sort** is an optimization of Insertion Sort that works by comparing elements separated by a certain gap and gradually reducing the gap. The last iteration of Shell Sort is a regular Insertion Sort with a gap of 1, ensuring that the array is almost sorted before the final pass.

<!-- - **Searching Algorithms**

  - The choice of a searching algorithm depends on factors such as the nature of the data, whether it is sorted, and the specific requirements of the search operation.
  - **Linear Search**, also known as Sequential Search, is a simple search algorithm that looks through each element in a list or array sequentially until the target element is found or the end of the list is reached.
  - **Interpolation Search** is an improved variant of binary search for uniformly distributed datasets. It estimates the position of the target element based on its value and the values of the endpoints.
  - **Exponential Search** is a search algorithm designed for sorted arrays. It involves determining a range where the target element might be present and then performing a binary search within that range.
  - **Jump Search** is a search algorithm that works on sorted arrays. It divides the array into blocks and jumps through these blocks to find the range where the target element might be, followed by a linear search within that range.
  - **Fibonacci Search** is a search algorithm that applies binary search within a narrow range determined by Fibonacci numbers. It narrows down the search space by using Fibonacci numbers to define the size of the subarray.
  - **Ternary Search** is a divide-and-conquer search algorithm similar to binary search but divides the search space into three parts instead of two. It requires sorted data and searches for the target element by reducing the search space to one-third in each step. -->
