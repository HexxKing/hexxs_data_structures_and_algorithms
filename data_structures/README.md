## ğŸ“š Implementation Roadmap

- **Arrays:** A collection of elements, each identified by an index or a key.
  - Operations:
    - Access (read/write) an element by index.
    - Search for an element.
    - Insert an element at a specific index.
    - Delete an element from a specific index.

<!-- - **Sets:** A collection of distinct elements.
  - Operations:
    - Insert an element.
    - Delete an element.
    - Check if an element is present.
    - Perform set operations (union, intersection, difference). -->

<!-- - **Disjoint Set (Union-Find):** A data structure that keeps track of a set of elements partitioned into disjoint sets.
  - Operations:
    - Create a new set with element x.
    - Merge the sets containing elements x and y.
    - Determine the set to which element x belongs.
    - Path compression and union-by-rank are often used for optimization. -->

<!-- - **Linked Lists:** A sequence of elements where each element points to the next one in the sequence.
  - Operations:
    - Traverse the list.
    - Insert an element at the beginning, end, or a specific position.
    - Delete an element from the beginning, end, or a specific position.
    - Search for an element. -->

<!-- - **Skip List:** A data structure that allows fast search, insertion, and deletion of elements from a sorted sequence.
  - Operations:
    - Find the node with key x.
    - Insert a new node with key x.
    - Remove the node with key x.
    - Perform operations within a specific range efficiently. -->

<!-- - **Stacks:** A Last In, First Out (LIFO) structure where elements are added and removed from the same end.
  - Operations:
    - Push (add) an element onto the stack.
    - Pop (remove) the top element from the stack.
    - Peek (view) the top element without removing it.
    - Check if the stack is empty. -->

<!-- - **Queues:** A First In, First Out (FIFO) structure where elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.
  - Operations:
    - Enqueue (add) an element to the rear.
    - Dequeue (remove) an element from the front.
    - Peek (view) the front element without removing it.
    - Check if the queue is empty. -->

<!-- - **Deque (Double-ended Queue):** A queue where elements can be added or removed from both ends.
  - Operations:
    - Add element x to the front.
    - Add element x to the back.
    - Remove the element from the front.
    - Remove the element from the back.
    - Return the element at the front without removing it.
    - Return the element at the back without removing it. -->

<!-- - **Priority Queue:** An abstract data type similar to a regular queue or stack, but each element has an associated priority.
  - Operations:
    - Add element x to the priority queue.
    - Remove and return the minimum (or maximum) element.
    - Return the minimum (or maximum) element without removing it.
    - Ensure the heap property is maintained after an operation. -->

<!-- - **Trees:**
  - **Binary Trees:** Each node has at most two children.
  - **Binary Search Trees (BST):** A binary tree where the left child is less than or equal to the parent, and the right child is greater.
    - Operations:
      - Traverse the tree (in-order, pre-order, post-order).
      - Search for a specific node.
      - Insert a new node.
      - Delete a node.
      - Find the height or depth of the tree. -->

<!-- - **Trie:** A tree-like structure used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are strings.
  - Operations:
    - Insert a word.
    - Search for a word.
    - Delete a word.
    - Autocomplete suggestions. -->

<!-- - **Hash Tables:** A data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, where keys are mapped to values.
  - Operations:
    - Insert a key-value pair.
    - Delete a key-value pair.
    - Search for a value given a key.
    - Handle collisions (e.g., using chaining or open addressing). -->

<!-- - **Hash Maps:** Similar to hash tables, providing key-value mappings.
  - Operations:
    - Add a key-value pair to the map.
    - Remove a key-value pair based on the key.
    - Retrieve the value associated with a given key.
    - Manage situations where two keys hash to the same location. -->

<!-- - **Graphs:**
  - **Directed Graphs:** Edges have a direction.
  - **Undirected Graphs:** Edges have no direction.
  - **Weighted Graphs:** Edges have weights.
    - Operations:
      - Traverse the graph (DFS, BFS).
      - Search for a specific node.
      - Insert a new node.
      - Delete a node.
      - Check if there is a path between two nodes. -->

<!-- - **Heaps:**
  - **Min Heap:** The value of each node is less than or equal to the values of its children.
  - **Max Heap:** The value of each node is greater than or equal to the values of its children.
    - Operations:
      - Insert an element.
      - Extract the minimum or maximum element.
      - Peek at the minimum or maximum element without removing it.
      - Heapify: Maintain the heap property. -->

<!-- - **Bloom Filter:** A space-efficient probabilistic data structure used to test whether an element is a member of a set.
  - Operations
    - Add element x to the filter.
    - Check if element x is in the filter (may have false positives).
    - Remove element x from the filter (note: not always supported). -->
